        A brief story of how and why I first started investing. 
        </p>
      <hr>
      <p>I began playing the piano when I was six. My competitive spirit and love for the instrument led me to compete in classical music competitions at a young age, but it was my discipline and patience with practicing that ultimately led to my <a href = "https://usomc-my.sharepoint.com/personal/admin_usomc_usomc_onmicrosoft_com/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fadmin%5Fusomc%5Fusomc%5Fonmicrosoft%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FEvent2014%2F2014%2Fconcerts%2FConcert6%2F06%5FJonathan%5FQin%2Emp4&referrer=StreamWebApp%2EWeb&referrerScenario=AddressBarCopied%2Eview%2E67cb2feb%2D960b%2D4809%2D96e0%2D59fb6de073ad" target="_blank">success</a> in winning them. Between cash-prizes of up to $100 for first place finishes and annual chinese-new-year red-envelope collections from relatives, I quickly ammassed a small fortune of almost a thousand dollars. This was a lot of money for a young child, which my father undoubtedly noticed, because one day he walked in with an unsolicited offer to invest my money in the stock market, guarenteeing that by doing so my money would double in seven years. After showing my skepticism, he sweetened the deal by offering to match my investment dollar-for-dollar, effectively doubling my money immediately. I agreed and happily parted with my hoard of cash.</p>

      <p>Over the next seven years, I would occasionally remember and wonder about that investment, but I never really thought about it too much.  By the time my father helped me open my own brokerage account before I left for college, I had all but forgotten that my father had invested money on my behalf; preoccupied with starting college, I didn't even bother checking my account. It wasn't until halfway through freshman year when I, on a whim, logged in for the first time to check my brokerage account. I was surprised to find 120 shares of $PFE up over 300% from its initial investment, as well over 30 quarters of dividends sitting as uninvested cash (in hindsight I had checked exactly during $PFE's COVID peak in late 2021). From that moment on, I was hooked on investing and the capital markets.</p>

      <p> As a seasoned investor and now hedge fund analyst out of university, I often think back to that initial investment and the lessons I learned from it. While my father is no professional investor, he demonstrated to me some key principles of investing: the importance of starting early, the power of compounding, and the value of patience and discipline. Thinking back, my parents have followed these same principles throughout my entire upbringing; they fueled my curiousity and love for learning at a young age, ensured the compounding of my knowledge and skills by encouraging my long term goals, and always addressed my failures and shortcomings with steadfast patience and support. Today, I still hold those 120 shares of $PFE not as an investment, but as a symbol of my parents' unwavering dedication to investing in me. They are a daily reminder to be patient, disciplined, and above all else, grateful through the highs and lows of my journey in both investing and in life. I have no plans to ever sell them.</p>
